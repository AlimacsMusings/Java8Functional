# To Do List - practical example
Imperative style code to implement flexible searching and sorting a list of tasks in a to do list.

Entry point is TaskList, which creates a data set, and tests variants of filter/sort.

Code is implemented using two sets of Chain of Responsibility pattern, one for the filter and one for the sort

Consider how the various parts might be made more declarative style
	loops replaced by streams
	functional composition using functions rather than the objects in Chain of Responsibility
